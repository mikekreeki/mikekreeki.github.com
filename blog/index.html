		<p>The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig,
(look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look
at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And that&rsquo;s the jury-box,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;and those twelve creatures,&rsquo; (she
was obliged to say &lsquo;creatures,&rsquo; you see, because some of them were animals,
and some were birds,) &lsquo;I suppose they are the jurors.&rsquo; She said this last word
two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought,
and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it
at all. However, &lsquo;jury-men&rsquo; would have done just as well.</p>

<p>The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. &lsquo;What are they
doing?&rsquo; Alice whispered to the Gryphon. &lsquo;They can&rsquo;t have anything to put down
yet, before the trial&rsquo;s begun.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re putting down their names,&rsquo; the Gryphon whispered in reply, &lsquo;for fear
they should forget them before the end of the trial.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stupid things!&rsquo; Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, &lsquo;Silence in the court!&rsquo; and the King
put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p>

<p>Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all
the jurors were writing down &lsquo;stupid things!&rsquo; on their slates, and she could
even make out that one of them didn&rsquo;t know how to spell &lsquo;stupid,&rsquo; and that he
had to ask his neighbour to tell him. &lsquo;A nice muddle their slates&rsquo;ll be in
before the trial&rsquo;s over!&rsquo; thought Alice.</p>

<p>One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not
stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an
opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little
juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of
it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one
finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no
mark on the slate.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Herald, read the accusation!&rsquo; said the King.</p>

<p>On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled
the parchment scroll, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of
Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!&rsquo;</p>
